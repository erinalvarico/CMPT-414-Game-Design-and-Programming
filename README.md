# CMPT-414-Game-Design-and-Programming
Under the supervision of Professor Ron Coleman at Marist College, the scripts, projects, and labs are influenced by the CMPT 414N Game Design &amp; Programming I Course. All commits are either assignments issued as practice and retention. The final project was conceptualized through a given prompt, however all code and development is my own.
